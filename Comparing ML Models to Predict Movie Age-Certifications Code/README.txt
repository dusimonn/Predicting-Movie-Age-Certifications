This folder contains everything necessary to reproduce our research which aimed to compare different ML Models to preduce Move age certifications.
We first preprocess the data, after each preprocessing step, we exported the transformed data into its own separate csv file.
We then trained and tested model 1 using Random Forest and generated confusion matrices, graphs, and classification reports.
We then trained and tested model 2 using kNN and generated confusion matrices, graphs, and classification reports.

coding.ipynb contains the code necessary to reproduce our results used in our report 
scrap.ipynb contains code used to calculate averages of the classification reports used for each model
